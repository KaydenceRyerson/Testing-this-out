Once a very very long time ago an intrepid hero dared to stand up
against the low-sodium cartel.  Our hero knew that the shortage of
pork belly could only have been caused by their brand of devious
evil.

The low-sodium cartel had reportedly been hoarding pork belly in
their underground lair.  There could only be one reason for this,

with evil in order to rescue the big pile of bacon.

It is dark and you light a torch...
